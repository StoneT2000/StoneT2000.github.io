Since Battlecode ended, I really did not want to wait a whole year for Battlecode season to come back. With the Coronavirus up and about, I had a lot of extra time so I built [Dimensions](https://github.com/stonet2000/dimensions), a generalized artificial intelligence framework that lets you build your own AI competition and platform easily. In this post I also introduce my observations from competiting in AI competitions for several years and make a case for a AI competition framework and its implications. The gif on the left is a gif of Dimensions running a Trueskill ranked tournament of [rock paper scissors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors).
