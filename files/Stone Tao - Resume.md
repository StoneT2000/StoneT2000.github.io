<a class='anchor' id='selected_projects-a'></a>

<h2 id='selected_projects'>Selected Projects</h2>
**IgushArray Java/JS** – Sept. 2019 to Present (Repository Link: https://github.com/StoneT2000/IgushArray-Java)

- Developed the first Java implementation of the IgushArray, which provides the time complexities on operations as the ArrayList, including **O(1)** access time, but with improved insert and removal times of **O(n<sup>1/2</sup>)**. Works as a one for one replacement for ArrayLists in code. Created JS version at https://github.com/StoneT2000/IgushArray-JS, which implements many of the same methods the built in JS array has according to the ECMA 262 specifications.

**AI Visuals** – Jan. 2019 to Present (Link: [stonet2000.github.io/AIVisuals](https://stonet2000.github.io/AIVisuals), Repository Link: [github.com/StoneT2000/AIVisuals/](https://www.github.com/StoneT2000/AIVisuals/))

- A personal project where I use raw Javascript and TensorFlow.js to create visualizers of the machine learning process. So far, I have implemented a simple polynomial fitter and K-means.

**Online English Learning Platform** – Sept. 2018 to May. 2019 (Link: [esee.isb.bj.edu.cn](http://esee.isb.bj.edu.cn), Repository Link: It is a private repository)

- Collaborated on developing a platform for local Chinese students to easily read English books from my school’s library anywhere and anytime. Created in collaboration with the Empowerment Through Self Esteem Education (ESEE) service club.
- Developed the front and back-end of the platform. Primary contributions are the overall design, book procession and integrating text-recognition for digitizing library books, live translation, and anti-cheat system for recording reading times.

**Polytomizator** – June 2018 (Link: [stonet2000.github.io/Polytomizator](https://stonet2000.github.io/Polytomizator), Repository Link: [github.com/StoneT2000/Polytomizator/](https://www.github.com/StoneT2000/Polytomizator/))

- Developed a user-friendly web app that allows users to create low-poly art in seconds compared to the hours it takes to create with Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator. Users can fine-tune the low-poly art or have the site auto-generate the art.
- A mix of image filtering, computer vision techniques, and Poisson disk sampling help auto-generate better low-poly art.
