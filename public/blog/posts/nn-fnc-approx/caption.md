I introduce some of my work on function approximation I did while I interned at QuantCo. We identified a few solutions and directions that help tackle some of the issues faced by function approximation of functions with high dimensionality and many discontinuities, namely using decision trees, neural networks, 2nd order optimization, and residual based splitting. Results also have some interesting applications from security to function compression.
